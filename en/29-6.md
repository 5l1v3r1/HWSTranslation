# Wrap up

I hope this game gave you lots to learn about mixing UIKit and SpriteKit, texture atlases, scene transitions, and of course destructible terrain – while also giving you another real-world project under your belt. If you’re following this series in order you've now made seven SpriteKit games of varying complexity, so I hope you have all the knowledge you need to get out there and make your own.

If you want to extend this project, you might want to consider starting with the art for a change: I've made it look relatively similar to the original DOS game, but let's face it that will only appeal to fans of retro gaming nowadays! If you're looking to change the code, see if you can make the game track scores across scenes so that players know who is winning.

If you're looking for something harder, make it best of 5: whoever reaches a score of 3 first wins, showing a "you win!" screen of your choosing. And for a real challenge, try to modify the collision detection so that exploding bananas damage all buildings the explosion would have touched rather than just the building the banana touched.
