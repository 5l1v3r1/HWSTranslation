# Wrap up

As your Swift skill increases, I hope you're starting to feel the balance of these projects move away from explaining the basics and toward presenting and dissecting code. Working with JSON is something you're going to be doing time and time again in your Swift career, and you've cracked it in about an hour of work – while also learning about `UITabBarController`, and more. Not bad!

If you're looking to extend this project some more, you might like to look at the original API documentation – it's at <https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers> and contains lots of options. If you add more view controllers to the tab bar, you'll find you can add up to five before you start seeing a "More" button. This More tab hides all the view controllers that don't fit into the tab bar, and it's handled for you automatically by iOS.
