# Wrap up

With `UIStackView` in place that's another UIKit component under your belt – good job! The addition of multitasking and size classes helps make the app much more polished, and I think you have the seeds of a great app here.

If you want to try extending this project, the sensible place to start is in the URL entry: if users don't type "http://" before their web site addresses the app fails, which isn't very helpful.

Another smart place to improve the app is inside the `setDefaultTitle()` method: it just writes Multibrowser in the navigation bar while leaving a large white space in the center – hardly intuitive, and it wouldn't be hard to add a placeholder label in there telling users what to do.
