# Wrap up

Debugging is a unique and essential skill that’s similar but different to regular coding. As you’ve just seen, there are lots of options to choose from, and you will – I promise! – use all of them at some point. Yes, even `print()`.

There's more to learn about debugging, such as the Step Into and Step Out commands, but realistically you need to start with what you have before you venture any further. I would much rather you mastered three of the debugging tools available to you rather than having a weak grasp of all of them.
