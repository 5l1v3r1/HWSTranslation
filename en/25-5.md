# Wrap up

Multipeer connectivity is something that used to be awfully hard, but in iOS it's less than 150 lines of code to produce this entire app – and over half of that is code for the collection view and the image picker!

The advantage it has compared to traditional data sharing over Wi-Fi is that multipeer can use an existing Wi-Fi network, or can silently create a new Wi-Fi network or even a Bluetooth network depending on what's available. All this is an implementation detail that Apple solves on your behalf.

If you'd like to take this project further, add a button that will show a table view listing the names of all devices currently connected to the session. You could also try sending text messages across the wire – there's a `data(using:)` method for strings that converts a string to `Data`. Use it with the parameters `String.Encoding.utf8` to ensure everything is sent safely.
