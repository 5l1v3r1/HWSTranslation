# Wrap up

Although I've tried to simplify things as much as possible, GCD still isn't easy. That said, it's much easier than the alternatives: GCD automatically handles thread creation and management, automatically balances based on available system resources, and automatically factors in Quality of Service to ensure your code runs as efficiently as possible. The alternative is doing all that yourself!

There's a lot more we could cover (not least how to create your own queues!) but really you have more than enough to be going on with, and certainly more than enough to complete the rest of this series. We'll be using GCD again, so it might help to keep this reference close to hand!
