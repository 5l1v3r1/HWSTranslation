# Setting up

Welcome to the second part of the series! From here on in, the apps you create will be looking beyond plain UIKit to explore some of the other great ways you can use Apple's tools to produce great apps. In this project you're going to create a Safari extension, which lets us embed a version of our app directly inside Safari's action menu, then manipulate Safari data in interesting ways.

What do I mean by "interesting ways"? Well, our little Safari extension is going to read in the URL and page title that the user was visiting, then show them a large text area they can type JavaScript into. When the extension is dismissed, we'll execute that JavaScript in Safari.

This is the first of two projects that are *hard*. This is not because I want to torture you, but because your skills are improving and it's time to tackle bigger things. In this project, the actual amount of code you're going to be writing is quite small, because most of the code will be provided for us by Xcode. However, it's dense, and there's a lot to take in, so it might feel like slow going.

At the very least, the project will still be useful and you'll learn a lot too â€“ not least about Safari extensions and a new class called `NotificationCenter`.

Let's get started: create a new Single View App project in Xcode, naming it Project16.
