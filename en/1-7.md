# Wrap up

This has been a very simple project in terms of what it can do, but you've also learned a huge amount about Swift, Xcode and storyboards. I know it's not easy, but trust me: you've made it this far, so you're through the hardest part.

To give you an idea of how far you've come, here are just some of the things we've covered: constants and variables, method overrides, table views and image views, app bundles, `FileManager`, typecasting, arrays, loops, optionals, view controllers, storyboards, outlets, Auto Layout, `UIImage` and more.

Yes, that's a *huge* amount, and to be brutally honest chances are you'll forget half of it. But that's OK, because we all learn through repetition, and if you continue to follow the rest of this series you'll be using all these and more again and again until you know them like the back of your hand.
