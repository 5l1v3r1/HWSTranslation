# Wrap up

You've made it this far, so your Swift learning really is starting to come together, and I hope this project has shown you that you can make some pretty advanced things with your knowledge.

In this project, you learned a little bit more about `UITableView`: how to reload their data and how to insert rows. You also learned how to add text fields to `UIAlertController` so that you can accept user input. But you also learned some serious core stuff: more about Swift strings, closures, method return values, booleans, `NSRange`, and more. These are things you're going to use in dozens of projects over your Swift coding career, and things we'll be returning to again and again in this series.

You may already have plans for how you'd like to improve this game, but if not here are some ideas to get you started:

1.  Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters. The easiest way to accomplish this is to put a check into `isReal()` that returns false if the word length is under three letters. If you don’t want to do that, at least disallow empty strings!
2.  Refactor all the `else` statements we just added so that they call a new method called `showErrorMessage()`. This should accept an error message and a title, and do all the `UIAlertController` work from there.
3.  Disallow answers that are just the start word. Right now, if the start word is "agencies" the user can just submit "agencies" as an answer, which is too easy – stop them from doing that.
4.  Fix our start.txt loading code. If the `path(forResource:)` call returns `nil` we load an array containing one word: silkworm. But what if `path(forResource:)` succeeds, but creating a `String` using `contentsOfFile` fails? Then the array is empty! Make a new `loadDefaultWords()` method that can be used for both failures.
