# Wrap up

Swift extensions are the smart way to add functionality to existing types, and you're going to meet them time and time again â€“ and hopefully write quite a few of your own too. They aren't all-encompassing, because they don't let you add properties to a class whereas a full subclass would, but they are easy to use and easy to share so I'm sure you'll use them frequently.

In this project, you've also learned a little of how useful Swift playgrounds can be for prototyping code, because the immediate feedback you get makes it extremely easy to try things out and make quick adjustments.
