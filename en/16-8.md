# Wrap up

I'll tell you what: *I'm* feeling tired and I didn't even have to learn anything to write this project â€“ I can't imagine how tired you are! But please don't be too disheartened: this project builds the the bridge between JavaScript and Swift, and now that bridge is built you can add your own Swift functionality on top.

Some of the code isn't pleasant to work with, and certainly I wish iOS would just figure out text view insets automatically for keyboards, but you're through it now so your project is done. Even though this was a hard project, I did cut quite a few corners in this project to make the code as easy as possible, so again I want to encourage you to try creating another extension and see how Apple's example code is different from mine.

If you'd like to make improvements to this project, you could try combining a number of techniques together to make a pretty awesome app.

You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so why not use `UserDefaults` to save the user's JavaScript for each site? You should convert the URL to a `URL` object in order to use its `host` property.

If you wanted to be really fancy, you could let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a `UITableView`.
