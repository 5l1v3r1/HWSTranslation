# Wrap up

`UICollectionView` and `UITableView` are the most common ways of showing lots of information in iOS, and you now know how to use both. You should be able to go back to project 1 and recognize a lot of very similar code, and that's by intention – Apple has made it easy to learn both view types by learning either one.

You've also learned another batch of iOS development, this time `UIImagePickerController`, `UUID`, custom classes and more. You might not realize it yet, but you have enough knowledge now to make a huge range of apps!

If you wanted to take this app further you could add a second `UIAlertController` that is shown when the user taps a picture, and asks them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.

You could also try `picker.sourceType = .camera` when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator!) so you might want to check the return value of `UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable()` before trying to use it!

Before we finish, you may have spotted one problem with this app: if you quit the app and relaunch, it hasn't remembered the people you added. Worse, the JPEGs are still stored on the disk, so your app takes up more and more room without having anything to show for it!

This is quite intentional, and something we'll return to fix in project 12. Before then, let's take a look at another game…
