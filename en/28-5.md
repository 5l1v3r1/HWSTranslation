# Wrap up

The great thing about biometric authentication is that you don't get any access to fingerprints, face scans, or other secure information. Instead, the system does all the authentication for you, which keeps both your app and users safe.

If you want to take this project further, try using the `#if` compiler directives from project 26 to make the `if true` hack work for the simulator and be in the code at the same time as the real Touch ID/Face ID code.

If you're looking for something harder, try creating a password system for your app so that the Touch ID/Face ID fallback is more useful. You'll need to use the `addTextField()` from project 5, and I suggest you save the password in the keychain!
