Working with iBeacon locations is different from working with maps. The technology is often called *micro-location* because it can tell the difference between a few centimeters and a meter or more. Plus it works inside, which is somewhere GPS continues to be poor, and understandably.

What you've produced is designed to do ranging, but you could easily make it ignore the range data and just focus on whether a beacon is present. For example, if the beacon in your house is present (regardless of range), you could make your app show home-related tasks that you have pre-configured.
