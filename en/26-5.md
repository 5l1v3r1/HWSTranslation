# Wrap up

There's something wonderfully tactile about using the accelerometer to affect gravity in a game, because it feels incredibly realistic even though we're not using particularly good graphics. SpriteKit is of course doing most of the hard work of collision detection, and Core Motion takes away all the complexity of working with accelerometers, so again it's our job to sew the components together to make something bigger than the sum of its parts.

There are two things you should immediately tackle if you want to continue working on this project. First, have a go at refactoring the `loadLevel()` method so that it's made up of multiple smaller methods. This will make your code easier to read and easier to maintain, at least it will do if you do a good job!

Second, when the player finally makes it to the finish marker, nothing happens. What should happen? Well, that's down to you now. You could easily design several new levels and have them progress through, but could you add things that make the new levels different â€“ perhaps a teleport that moves the player from one point in the level to another? Add a new letter type in `loadLevel()`, add another collision type to our enum, then see what you can do. Have fun!
