# Wrap up

I've enjoyed making this project, so I hope you enjoyed following along. Plus you have yet more Swift coding experience under your belt, now complete with `Timer`, `follow()`, color blending and, yes, even the shake gesture â€“ although I wouldn't be surprised if you switch to having a button on the screen to make explosions easier!

There's a lot more you can do with this foundation behind you. How about adding a score label? Or perhaps adding different fireworks spread types, for example one where fireworks launch from the left *and* right?

Or if you fancy a bigger challenge, how about making the game end after a certain number of launches? You will need to use the `invalidate()` method of `Timer` to stop it from repeating.
