# Wrap up

You *will* use `UserDefaults` in your projects. That isn't some sort of command, just a statement of inevitability. If you want to save any user settings, or if you want to save program settings, it's just the best place for it. And I hope you'll agree it is (continuing a trend!) easy to use and flexible, particularly when your own classes conform to `Codable`.

As you saw, the `NSCoding` protocol is also available. Yes, it takes extra work to use, and can be quite annoying when your data types have lots of properties you need to save, but it does have the added benefit of Objective-C compatibility if you have a mixed codebase.

One proviso you ought to be aware of: please don't consider `UserDefaults` to be safe, because it isn't. If you have user information that is private, you should consider writing to the keychain instead â€“ something we'll look at in project 28.
