# Wrap up

That's it! We just made a game in 20 minutes or so, which shows you just how fast SpriteKit is. I even showed you how per-pixel collision detection works (it's so easy!), how to advance particle systems so they start life with some history behind them, and how to adjust linear and angular damping so that objects don't slow down over time.

If you're tempted to work on this project some more, you could start by fixing a bug: if the player gets in a difficult position, they can just remove their finger from the screen then touch somewhere else to have the spaceship immediately jump there. How could you fix this? Well, one easy way is to add code for `touchesEnded()` that terminates the game if the player stops touching the screen.

If you're looking for something bigger to try, how about turning this game into a full space shooter. To do this, you need to create lasers going the opposite way, then make those lasers also collide with the space debris. In terms of controls, it wouldn't be hard to use `touchesMoved()` to move the player and `touchesBegan()` to fire lasers.
