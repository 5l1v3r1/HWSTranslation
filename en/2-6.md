# Wrap up

This is another relatively simple project, but it's given you the chance to go over some concepts in a little more detail, while also squeezing in a few more concepts alongside. Going over things again in a different way is always helpful to learning, so I hope you don't view this game (or any of the games we'll make in this series!) as a waste of time.

Yes, in this project we revisited Interface Builder, Auto Layout, outlets and other things, but at the same time you've learned about @2x and @3x images, asset catalogs, integers, doubles, floats, operators (`+=` and `-=`), `UIButton`, enums, `CALayer`, `UIColor`, random numbers, actions, string interpolation, `UIAlertController`, and more. And you have a finished game too!

If you feel like working on this app some more, see if you can figure out how to place a `UILabel` onto the view controller and connect it via an outlet, then show the player's score in there rather than in a `UIAlertController`. You'll need to use your label's `text` property along with string interpolation to make it work. Good luck!
