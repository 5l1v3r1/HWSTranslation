# Protocol-oriented programming for beginners

One of Swift’s most powerful features is its ability to extend whole swathes of data types at the same time. This is a pretty advanced topic known as protocol-oriented programming, but I want to at least give you a taster of what’s possible – if you’re interested in learning more, you should [check out my Pro Swift book](https://gum.co/proswift).

To demonstrate how this works, let’s look at another simple extension for the `Int` data type: we’re going to add a `squared()` method that multiples an integer by itself.

    extension Int {
        func squared() -> Int {
            return self * self
        }
    }

    let i: Int = 8
    print(i.squared())

I explicitly made `i` an `Int` for a reason: there are other kinds of integers available in Swift. For example, `UInt` is an unsigned integer, which means it sacrifices the ability to hold negative numbers in exchange for the ability to hold much larger positive numbers.

There are also integers of different sizes, e.g. `Int8` holds an integer made up of 8 binary digits, which holds a maximum value of 127, and `UInt64` is the largest type of integer and holds up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 – that’s 18 quintillion four hundred and forty-six quadrillion in case you were wondering.

Our extension modifies the `Int` data type specifically, rather than *all* variations of integers, which means code like this won’t work because `UInt64` doesn’t have the extension:

    let j: UInt64 = 8
    print(j.squared())

Swift’s solution is to let us create protocol extensions: extensions that modify several data types at once.

You’ve already seen how the `self` keyword lets us refer to our current value, so `self * self` means “multiply my current number by itself.” Well, there’s also `Self` with a capital S, which has a subtly different meaning: it means “my current data type.” So, `self` means “my current value” and `Self` means “my current data type.”

This *matters* when it comes to extending protocols because of the way our `squared()` method is declared. Take a look again:

    func squared() -> Int {
        return self * self
    }

If we want `squared()` to apply to all types of integer, we can’t very well make it return `Int` - that’s not big enough to hold the full range of a `UInt64`, so Swift will refuse to build. Instead, we need to make the method return `Self`, which means “I’ll return whatever data type I was used with.”

Here’s the rewritten extension:

    extension BinaryInteger {
        func squared() -> Self {
            return self * self
        }
    }

This time I’ve made it apply to `BinaryInteger`, which is the protocol applied to `Int`, `Int8`, `UInt64`, and so on. This means *all* integer types get access to the `squared()` method, and work as expected.
