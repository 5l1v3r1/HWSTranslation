# Wrap up

You have another game under your belt, and I hope your brain is already starting to bubble up ideas for things you can do to improve it. Plus, you learned more skills, not least `SKCropNode`, `SKTexture`, GCD's `asyncAfter()`, the `*=` and `-=` operators, forcing method labels, plus lots of new `SKAction` types, so it's all time well spent.

If you're looking to improve this project, you could start by adding a smoke-like particle effect to be used when the penguins are hit, and perhaps a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole. You could also record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.

Try experimenting with the difficulty and see what you come up with â€“ is it easier or harder if the penguin show/hide animation happens at random speeds?
