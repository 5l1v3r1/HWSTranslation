# Wrap up

This project is done, and it's been a long one, but I hope you look at the results and think it was all worth it. Plus, you've once again learned a lot: SpriteKit, physics, blend modes, radians and `CGFloat`.

Youâ€™ve got the firm foundations of a real game here, but there's lots more you can do to make it even better. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- The Content folder you copied in has other ball pictures rather than just ballRed. Generate a random number and choose ball colors randomly.
- Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.
- Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
- Make clicking on an obstacle box in editing mode remove it.

And if you were wondering how to get rid of the node and frames per second counts in your game, look inside the GameViewController.swift file for these two lines:

    view.showsFPS = true
    view.showsNodeCount = true
