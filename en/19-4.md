# Wrap up

I tried to keep this project as simple as possible so that you can focus on the map component, because there's a lot to learn: `MKMapView`, `MKAnnotation`, `MKPinAnnotationView`, `CLLocationCoordinate2D` and so on, and all must be used before you get a finished product.

Again, we've only scratched the surface of what maps can do in iOS, but that just gives you more room to extend the app yourself! Try adding a `UIAlertController` action sheet that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a `mapType` property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, `.satellite` gives a satellite view of the terrain.

If you want to try something harder, you could typecast the return value from `dequeueReusableAnnotationView()` so that it's an `MKPinAnnotationView`. This will always be the case, because that's what we're creating. But once you typecast the return value, it means you can change the `pinTintColor` property to your favorite `UIColor`. With that information, try to add a "Favorite" button to cities: regular cities are red, favorites are green.
